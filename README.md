Assignment description: Design a simple form to cut/engrave on the laser using your own materials.

The final project was adapted from Steve Wintercroft's "Bird Half Mask" which is available for personal use. For this project,
I used 1/4" cardboard. To make the complete cuts, I used the default cardboard settings from the material library. For the 
half-cuts in order to create the allowances for the mountain folds, I increased the speed by 30 and reduced the power by 20.
I would likely double up the half-cuts if I were to create this again, as it was not very easy to fold it and required some
additional work from a snap-blade. There were no tabs to the paper craft, so it was very helpful to use hot-glue and duct
tape to hold the cardboard together.
